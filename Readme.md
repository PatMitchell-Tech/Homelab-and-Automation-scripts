Here is my homelab. I run many services using docker such as a bedrock minecraft server and homepage dashboard to manage my running services.
In my homelab my main goal is to learn more about running services and automation. I enjoy finding out how to setup and run things as efficiently and securely as possible.
I also run pihole and a webserver to directly manage it.
